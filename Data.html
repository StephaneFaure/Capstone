This use case should leverage two data sources:
<br>
<UL>
<li>Foursquare APIs will be used to retrieve the coordinates of all Italian and Fast Food restaurants in the city of Totonto .These data will be reworked to cluster the zones where there is the higher density of the restaurant. The cluster algorithm will be a density based algorithm using the Euclidian distance between restaurants as main clusterfactor.</li>
<li>Toronto postal code coordinates list that will be used to create the end to end path from high density desired restaurants zones using the edges (east and west) and centers of clustered areas.</li>
</ul>
<br>
All along the project, interactive maps will be used to visualize restaurants, cluster of restaurants and at the end the optimized end to end proposed path.
