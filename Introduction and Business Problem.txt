Governments of United States of America and Canada have planned a meeting between their leaders. The precise day is not yet decided but an early agenda has been negociated: President Trump will land in Toronto Pearson International Airport at 11:30am and use a limo to cross over Toronto city from west to east in order to join Prime Minister Trudeau near Kew Gardens park, on the other side of the city. At the request of White House staff, the last detail to be decided is the path from the airport to the park.
Since President Trump will travel across Toronto at lunch time, it is likely that he will get ungry and decide to stop for a bite before reaching the final destination. President secretary knows that when the President get too much hungry he can come angry which would endanger the negociation. As a result, President’s staff asked Canada authorities to provide a path from the airport to the park that will maximize the proximity with favorite President dishes: pizzas and hamburgers. It is very important that, all along the crossing of Toronto, President should be able to hit quickly so he is in the best state-of-mind for the discussions. This is crucial  for both Governments of United States of America and Canada.
White House staff expects the list of postal code areas to cross from the airport to the park with a map of selected restaurants along the road.
The confidential audience of this study is the bureau of Government of Canada and Secret Services of United states of America.
